C[gunnar Q Did Viking play second move from opening book?
];W[eg]
;B[cf];W[gh]C[zapp Q I did not see it play it
];B[ec]
C[gunnar Q (It was very fast.)
gunnar Q G2 looks a bit low.
zapp Q Then it was
]
;W[fb];B[eb]C[gunnar Q GNU thinks W+6.
gunnar Q G5 was third move.
]
;W[gf];B[dg]C[zapp Q Viking thinks it is 50+50
gunnar Q W+10 now.
gunnar Q GNU very pessimistic.
]
;W[dh];B[ch]C[zapp Q Should be with big komi
zapp Q Viking tends to always beat gnu in a game like this
gunnar Q W+12. It gets worse with every move.
]
;W[cg];B[bg]C[gunnar Q C3?
zapp Q Can be a symptom that Viking is behind
Dssq 9k : C3 = 9P move
]
;W[ei];B[ge]C[gunnar Q Finally G5.
gunnar Q W+4 now.
];W[fe]
;B[fd]C[zapp Q Viking was thinking of H5
zapp Q but ran out of time
gunnar Q Ah, F5 didn't look very good.

;W[ff];B[gd]C[zapp Q I am playing on my laptop today
zapp Q Last time I had my father 3Ghz machine
gunnar Q What speed?
zapp Q 1.7

;W[hd];B[hb]
C[zapp Q And that tournament I think the time per game was longer

;W[hc];B[he]
C[gunnar Q GNU is playing on a 1.6 GHz Athlon (marketing name XP1900+)
]
;W[ea];B[fc]
C[zapp Q Does it play much stronger using more time on 9x9
]
;W[gb]C[gunnar Q Doubtful.
];B[id]
C[gunnar Q GNU thinks the corner will die.
zapp Q For Viking every second makes a difference
]
;W[ic];B[ha]C[zapp Q Viking agrees with that
];W[cb];B[da];W[fa]
C[zapp Q At 3 minutes per move Viking is pretty good
];B[db]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh]C[zapp Q Good game for gnu
gunnar Q Looks like white collapsed.
gunnar Q G2 was a gift.
zapp Q As a said: at C3 viking probably felt it was behind
gunnar Q Interesting that they both thought so. :-)
zapp Q I should have implemented an idea to spend twice the time on first move out of book
zapp Q I am rerunning Viking for position it played G2
gunnar Q What is the right move?
zapp Q 1ply G3 2ply G3 3ply G4
zapp Q Which means it played G2 because of the random nature of monte carlo eval
